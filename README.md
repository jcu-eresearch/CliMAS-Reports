CliMAS Reports
==============

This repo contains the third tool from a set of three.

The three tools are:
- CliMAS Suitability (models species suitability across Australia and into the future)
- CLiMAS Biodiversity (models diversity of species within class, family and genus)
- CliMAS Reports (generates a nicely formatted, printable report describing your area)

This tool is documented, and has issues recorded, in the repo that contains the other two:
